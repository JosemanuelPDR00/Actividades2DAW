            <div class="texto">When I found out I was going to be learning how to work with CSS, I was about to break down into tears - happy tears, of course! I could not believe one of my lifelong dreams was about to come true: I would be learning the most beautiful
            style sheet language in the whole world. It was not always easy, though - there were some bumps on the road. But with my steely determination and the help from my extremely talented, knowledgeable and humble teacher, I was able to overcome every 
            difficulty that came upon me. Maybe learning CSS is the best thing that has ever happened to me; it has spurred my creativity in ways I no longer thought possible. I will always love and cherish CSS and here are some of my delicately crafted webpages 
            to attest to it.

                <p class="textoContenedor">I could see CSS was going to be as challenging as fascinating, and that made me all the more excited. We can all see these were no masterpieces, but <strong>Vanilla CSS</strong> is full of charm anyway, don't you think?</p>
