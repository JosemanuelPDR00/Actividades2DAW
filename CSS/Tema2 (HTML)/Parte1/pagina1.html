    <h1>What is a vegan diet?</h1>


    <h4><strong>A vegan diet is a diet that is strictly vegetarian.</strong> Besides not eating meat,
    <mark>strict vegetarians do not eat any type of food that comes from animals.</mark> This includes
    products <em>dairy, eggs, honey and gelatin</em> (which comes from bones and other animal tissues).

    <dd>There are many reasons why some people choose a vegan diet:</dd></h4>

    <ul>
        <li>May be healthier than other diets.</li>
        <li>Some people think it is wrong to use animals for food.</li>
        <li>Some religions prohibit eating meat.</li>
        <li>A vegan diet can cost less than a diet that includes meat.</li>
        <li>Eating less meat may be better for the environment, because most meat is produced commercially.</li>
        <li>Some people don't like the taste of meat.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Select about the foods to know where to go to buy them at the best price.</h2>

        <strong>Veganism is more than just a diet thing.</strong> Vegans avoid killing, harming, and exploiting 
        animals and maintain a good level of physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health and well-being.
        It is an ethical and healthy alternative to consumption and dependence on products of animal origin not 
        adapted to our physical and spiritual needs. In contrast to veganism, vegetarianism may seem like a partial 
        and inconsistent solution. However, becoming (ovo-lacto-) vegetarian is already a big step. The generic 
        term "vegetarian" encompasses all approaches within this way of seeing things. Any step towards veganism,
        no matter how small, is positive for your own well-being and that of the animals. The differences between
        "vegan" and "vegetarian" express a degree of commitment that evolves over time. The benefits of a 
        vegetarian diet come exclusively from its vegan component. Cheese has more fat than meat and comes from 
        the same place. Eggs have more cholesterol than chicken and come from the same place. None of them 
        contain fiber, carbohydrates, or anything else that cannot be found in healthier plant foods.
