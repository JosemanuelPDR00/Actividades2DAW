            a matching red Phrygian cap, making him the only Smurf who does not wear white. He was introduced in Peyo's 1958 Johan and Peewit story

            of the Gauls' magic potion when he was a baby, causing him to be the only Gaul in Asterix's village who is in a permanent state of superhuman
            strength. Because of this already enormous strength, Obelix is not allowed to drink the magic potion ever again, a ban he regards as being
