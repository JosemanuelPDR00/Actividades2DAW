        <p class="texto1">Chess boxing, or chessboxing, is a hybrid sport that combines two traditional
        pastimes: chess and boxing. The competitors compete in alternating rounds of 
        chess and boxing.</p>

        <div id="contenedorImagen"><img src="./cb.jpg"></div>
    
        <p class="texto1">The basic idea in Chessboxing is to combine the number one thinking sport with
        the number one fighting sport into a merger sport that demands the most of its
        competitors - both mentally and physically.</p>

            <div class="texto">The concept of Chessboxing was first coined in the 1979 Kung Fu film
                <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0199813/">Mystery of Chessboxing</a> made by Joseph Kuo.
                The first Chessboxing event was put on by Dutch performance artist 
                <a href="https://twitter.com/ieperubingh">Iepe Rubingh.</a>. Rubingh's idea to create a new sport
                fusing the two disciplines, chess and boxing, originates from the 1992 comic Froid Équateur —written
                by French comic book artist  <a href="https://www.normaeditorial.com/autor/bilal-enki">Enki Bilal</a>
                — that portrays a chessboxing world championship.

            <div class="texto">In the comic book version, however, the opponents fight an entire boxing match before they face each
                other in a game of chess. Finding this to be impractical, Rubingh developed the idea further until it
                turned into the competitive sport that chessboxing is today with alternating rounds of chess and boxing
                and a detailed set of <a href="https://www.rulesofsport.com/sports/chess-boxing.html">rules and regulations</a>.</div>

                <div class="texto">A chessboxing match can end by any of the following:</div>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Victory by checkmate in chess.</li>
                        <li>Loss due to exceeding the chess game's time control (9 minutes with no increments).</li>
                        <li>Victory due to disqualification of their opponent by the referee e.g. due to inactivity due
                            to overextended playing time (chess or boxing rounds following multiple warnings).</li>
                    </ul>

                        In the case that neither of the chessboxers win in regulation time and the chess game ends in a
                        draw, the fighter who is ahead on boxing points wins the overall bout. In case the scoreboard is
                        also tied, the fighter that used the black chess pieces will be named the winner 
                        (due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-move_advantage_in_chess">first-move advantage in chess</a>).
